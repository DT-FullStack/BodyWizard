When I started this project, I only knew HTML and basic CSS.
As it stands, this project shows a very good understanding of Javascript, jQuery, PHP, and SASS/CSS.
In development I've also learned version management, package management, and command line tools.

As such, this repository demonstrates my self-driven ability to learn new coding languages and my tenacity in doing so.

Although I spent many hours writing (and revising) this app, it never reached production. I stopped working on this project when I decided to take in-depth courses to become a full stack engineer. After completing a lot of coding-boot-camp type classes, I returned to this project in order to clean it up and make it presentable for my portfolio.

** I acknowledge that the code base is bloated and the structure of the app leaves a lot to be desired **
** If I were to write this app now, there would be a lot of structural differences to increase performance and readability **
