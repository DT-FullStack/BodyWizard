  When I started this project, I only knew HTML and basic CSS.<br>
  As it stands, this project shows a very good understanding of Javascript, jQuery, PHP, and SASS/CSS.<br>
  In development I've also learned version management, package management, and command line tools.<br>
</p>

As such, this repository demonstrates my self-driven ability to learn new coding languages and my tenacity in doing so.<br>

Although I spent many hours writing (and revising) this app, it never reached production. I stopped working on this project when I decided to take in-depth courses to become a full stack engineer. After completing a lot of coding-boot-camp type classes, I returned to this project in order to clean it up and make it presentable for my portfolio.<br>

<p>** I acknowledge that the code base is bloated and the structure of the app leaves a lot to be desired **</p>

<p>** If I were to write this app now, there would be a lot of structural differences to increase performance and readability **</p>
